# i3-new-workspace

This script checks for existing workspaces in i3 and creates a new one with the lowest number possible. Optionally it can move the focused container to the newly created workspace.

You probably want to add a key binding to run this script.

## Usage:
* create a new workspace &mdash; `./i3-new-workspace.sh`
* create a new workspace and move the focused container &mdash; `./i3-new-workspace.sh move`
