# i3-new-workspace

This script checks for existing workspaces and creates a new one with the lowest number possible. Optionally it can move the focused container to the newly created workspace.

You probably want to add a key binding to run this script.

## Usage
* create a new workspace: `./i3-new-workspace.sh`
* create a new workspace and move the focused container: `./i3-new-workspace.sh move`
